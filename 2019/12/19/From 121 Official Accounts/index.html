	  <p><em><strong>The following was my experience and translated by me. If those is not clear,please be understanding.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>To classmate:</strong> lei, I’ll break the agreement of that state enterprise.Because JD(JD airline company) tells me don’t seek job.The training may begin soon. So I planned to do it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>To father:</strong> Dad, I planned to be a pilot, because this job is extraordinary prospect for me and I am lose interest in my major. I have passed all the physical examination and got a offer from JD airline.The training will be started soon.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>To Girlfriend:</strong> Dear，we’ll have married when I’ve finished the pilot lesson and became a really pilot. The pilot’s treatment is sure to give you a better lifestyle in this city.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>To relatives:</strong> Uncle，I wanna be a pilot, but there are necessary to put out lots of money to pay the training fee. Could you help me？ I can pay back that money in the future.</em></p>
<p><strong>All this fantasy, I force myself to recognize the reality today.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that I cut class to attend the polit physical examination in a chilly winter which was four years ago. Surprisingly,I passed it. My family held a long time meeting. Mom supposed  pilot is dangerous job and Dad supported me. He thinks a man should be ambitious.</p>
<p>Maybe too young to simple, I naively believe passing the physical examination means that I will have been enrolled by CAFUC(Civil Aviation Flight University of China). Many girl who are my classmate actively talks with me.So that I coundn’t control myself and fell in love at those time.Obviously,finally I was fail in the last examination.<br>For the fail, It’s completely mistake of myself.</p>
<p>She chose a university which’s local in hometown, and  I picked up a travelling bag going to Beijing for studying. But my university is not well so that I studied seriously for continueing to be a pilot when I  graduated.Only if I get a bachelor degree can I became a pilot.</p>
<p>For catching up the dream which I had destroyed with my own hands, I have insisted to exercise and got scholarship for four years.I passed CET4 and CET6 at once,you shoud know that just one passed CET6 in my whole class. Now I also get a good score in the exam of IELTS.</p>
<p>It’s luckily that HNA(Hainan Airline) was located on Beijing. I had waited for half a year，HNA didn’t published recruit yet.Time going fly, HNA published it near the spring festival.Although I known that HNA is in some troubles about finance, I still insisted on HNA is my first choose. Because  I believe a starved camel is still bigger than a horse, HNA is that camel.</p>
